            <h1>People in the history of Internet</h1>
            <p>Before the internet individuals would have to go to the record store to find the music that you are
                looking for and purchase a CD. Individuals such as David Weekly, Justin Frankel, Cabel Sasser, and Steve
                Frank thought differently. They were music lovers who started playing around with technology and put
                tunes together with PC’s the web and internet. MP3’s made music easier to move back and forth around the
                net. Frank, Sasser and Frankel created downloadable media players Audion and Winamp. These were
                applications that allowed users to store and play music in the form of MP3’s on their computers. Music
                lovers and internet enthusiasts became extremely excited about the idea of distributing and accessing
                mp3’s online. </p>

                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>Shawn Fanning a student at the Boston University used this opportunity to create Napster. Napster is a
                peer-to-peer file sharing internet software that allowed individuals to share digital audio files. As
                Napster become popular the company ran into legal issues such as copyright infringement eventually
                leading to the company’s demise. Napster encouraged other companies such as Apple to create iTunes where
                songs were sold for $0.99 each with strict copy right laws. </p>

            <div class="text-center mt-3 mb-3">
                <figure class="figure">
                    <img class="rounded " width="210" height="275" src="../images/shawn_fanning.jpg">

                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>Napster also laid out a foundation for webs startups such as YouTube. Although YouTube does take down
                copy righted material as soon as the owner asks it to it still faces legal issues. The difference
                between YouTube and Napster is that YouTube is not an underfunded startup and is funded by Google
                acquired YouTube by the end of 2006. Furthermore, YouTube created a platform that allowed users to
                create their own content and entertaining themselves. Users no longer needed to watch content made by
                big media. </p>

            <p>Other sites such as Craigslist, Flickr, Digg, and Match.com, posting online videos was just one of many
                ways where people had the ability to become active users on the web. Individuals were able to share
                music, sell items, and share pictures of themselves to find a date a new Era began where content was
                created by web users. This led to the Web 2.0 which refers to websites that emphasize user generated
                content, and allows users to share, collaborate, and communicate such as Myspace, and Facebook. </p>
