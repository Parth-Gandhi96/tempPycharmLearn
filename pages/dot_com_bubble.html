            <p> The web turned into a place of business. Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay thought that using the web and
                the power of technology to create an online marketplace that was efficient. Where regular people could
                compete on a level playing field with the big players. Omidyar believed that an auction site on the web
                would be more fair and accessible than any existing market. Within months of launching eBay Omidyar was
                earning thousands of dollars in fees. eBay’s initial public offering
                was very successful, and its stocks soared that first day. By the end of it the company was valued over
                2 billion dollars. </p>

            <p> Similarly, Jeff Bezos founder of Amazon also created an online marketplace where books would be shipped
                to all 50 states in the United States and 45 different countries. Amazon also had great success as an
                ecommerce website. The start of the boom in 1995 there were never more than 30 internet companies to go
                public in any given year. In 1999 the total number of internet IPO’s was 250. eBay and Amazon led the
                ecommerce marketplace where eBays market value on NASDAQ was 21 billion dollars. Amazon had sales of 1.6
                billion dollars per year and its own market cap was 37 billion. </p>

            <p> The dot.com bubble was a stock market bubble that was caused by excessive speculation of internet
                related companies. The late1990’s was a period of massive growth in the use of the internet. Between
                1995 and the 2000’s NASDAQ’s index rose tremendously only to fall and crash shortly after. During the
                crash, many online marketplace companies as well as communications companies failed and ended up
                shutting down. The companies such as eBay and Amazon survived. Amazon and eBay were able to survive
                because they understood that the most successful ecommerce companies did more than just use the web to
                sell items. They used the web to give power to the people so that they can use the tools in a way they
                see fit. Furthermore both companies set a new standard for customer service. They had a deep
                understanding and relentless focus on their customers. </p>
