            <h1>Internet Search</h1>

            <p> Jerry Yang and David Filo two electrical engineering graduates were students at Stanford University when
                they created a website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web” soon evolving into Yahoo.
                The founders had to come up with a way to keep Yahoo funded and alive. Jerry and David resorted to
                banner advertisements, fearful that there would be ramifications and repercussions that advertisements
                would be bad for their users and the users would rebel. Late in 1995 Yahoo began taking banner
                advertisements. Yahoo’s users multiplied which led to more advertisements, resulting in more money for
                the company. For the first time Yahoo had shown that it was possible to make money on the web creating
                the web boom. </p>

            <p> By 1996 Yahoo faced numerous competitors their biggest being Excite. Like Yahoo Excite was a search
                start up also founded by Stanford student Joe Kraus. The technology that Excite created was more
                sophisticated than that od Yahoo’s. Rather than a list of sites that were sorted into categories by
                human beings Excite’s technology was pure software. By 1997 the internet was booming and had many search
                engine websites that were competing with one another to become portals. The immense competition caused
                these companies to lose sight of why they really started, to find information. When users would try to
                find information, they would come up empty and with another site trying to sell them something that they
                did not even want. </p>

            <p> By 1998 Once again, by Stanford graduate students Larry Page and Sergey Brin created Google. Over the
                next few years google caught the attention of Silicon Valley investors. Sun co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim
                wrote the founders a check for 100,000 and Google Inc. was created. Google’s biggest challenge was how
                the company will make money without the use of advertisements. The founders were not against
                advertisements but wanted them to be user friendly. Google decided to separate advertisements from the
                organic search results ultimately making them millions of dollars. Google decided to go public with an
                initial public offering and was very successful. Three years after the offering Google was valued higher
                than McDonalds’, Coke, FedEx, Intel, IBM or Walmart. </p>
