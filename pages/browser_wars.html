            <h1>Browser Wars</h1>
            <p> Still not popular to the public the creation of the web was solely for scientists and tech nerds. Until
                a group of students from the University of Illinois created the Mosaic Browser. Jim Clark, a tech
                investor, saw the Mosaic Browser as an opportunity and collaborated with the students and launched their
                first browser. The Netscape Navigator. At the time Microsoft dominated the market share and had control
                of the software platform. Netscape’s sudden success became impossible for Microsoft to ignore. Bill
                Gates immediately made Microsoft’s focus towards web development to match and beat its new biggest
                competitor. This was the start of the Browser wars. </p>

            <div class="text-center">
                <img class="rounded mt-3 mb-5" src="../images/browser_wars_inside.jpg">
            </div>
            <p> Microsoft made Netscape an offer that they could not refuse. A onetime one-million-dollar fee to
                unlimited access to all of Netscape’s technology. If Netscape refused the deal, then Microsoft would use
                its resources to copy everything that they did. Netscape decided to launch an initial public offering
                and it was extremely successful. Jim Clark had invested 5 million into Netscape and earned 663 million
                on the day of the initial public offering. Marc Andreesen had publicly criticized Microsoft numerous
                times resulting in Microsoft releasing its own web browser- Internet Browser.
                Microsoft’s plan to destroy Netscape was straightforward: Analyze every move of Netscape, imitate it,
                and to release version after version of internet explorer to slowly chip away at Netscape’s browser
                market share. Bill Gates took an extra step by hiring Salesman to sell internet explore to every
                Microsoft customer and to sell their software to PC manufacturers. Microsoft even threatened Compact and
                told them if they had distributed Netscape’s browser, they would cancel their Windows licenses. Compact
                would be out of business without their Windows licenses so they did not distribute Netscape’s
                browser. </p>

            <div class="text-center">
                <img class="rounded mt-3 mb-5" src="../images/browser_wars_inside_real.jpg">
            </div>
            <p> The competition increased and both companies began to release newer versions of their browsers. With is
                endless resources Microsoft decided to go one step further by offering its browser for free by bundling
                it with the Windows Operating System. This led to Netscape demise because they had to charge for its
                browser to survive. Microsoft had won the browser wars and Netscape had sold its company to AOL.
                Netscape filed an Anti-Trust law suit against Microsoft stating that “it used its windows monopoly to
                engage in a wide variety of predatory and exclusionary business practices to prevent consumers from
                accessing Netscape’s products” resulting in its downfall. Microsoft was found guilty and Gates handed
                his position of CEO to Steve Ballmer. </p>
