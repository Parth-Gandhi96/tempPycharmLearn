                            On Oct. 4, 1957, Sputnik 1 successfully launched and entered Earth's orbit. Thus, began the space age. The successful launch shocked the world, giving the former Soviet Union the distinction of putting the first human-made object into space. The word 'Sputnik' originally meant 'fellow traveler,' but has become synonymous with 'satellite' in modern Russian.

                            On October 1, 1958, NASA officially opened for business with five facilities inherited from the NACA: Lewis Research Center in Ohio, Langley Research Center and the Wallops rocket test range in Virginia, and Ames Research Center and the Muroc aircraft test range in California. That same day, Eisenhower issued an executive order transferring space projects and appropriations from other space programs to NASA. These gave NASA 8,240 staff (8,000 from the NACA) and a budget of approximately $340 million.

                            On 24 July 1961 MIT accepts Leonard Kleinrock's doctoral dissertation "Information Flow in Large Communication Nets." This work is considered the first paper on packet-switching theory.The importance of Kleinrock's theory quickly became evident. Indeed, the Internet as we know it today could not function without packet switching. This approach, developed by a series of scientists and engineers in the 1960s, revolutionized the way that digital information was sent along communications lines.

                            The first recorded description of the social interactions that could be enabled through networking was a series of memos written by J.C.R. Licklider of MIT in August 1962 discussing his “Galactic Network” concept. He envisioned a globally interconnected set of computers through which everyone could quickly access data and programs from any site. In spirit, the concept was very much like the Internet of today.

                            Larry Roberts designed this seminal network. The ARPAnet went live in October of 1969, when the first transmission was sent from a machine at the University of California at Los Angeles to one at the Stanford Research Institute 350 miles away. Leonard Kleinrock led the team at UCLA, and one of the graduate students working alongside him was Vint Cerf.

                            Aware of Roberts’ frustration, Kahn suggested staging a public demonstration to motivate network completion. Roberts liked the idea and asked Kahn to manage the effort. Kahn agreed and recommended the demonstration be held at either a Spring or Fall Joint Computer Conference. Roberts, however, preferred a brand new conference, the International Conference on Computer Communications (ICCC), to be held October 24-26, 1972 in Washington D. C. The persuasive Roberts prevailed.

                        <p class="description">
                            Raymond Samuel Tomlinson (April 23, 1941 – March 5, 2016) was a pioneering American computer programmer who implemented the first email program on the ARPANET system, the precursor to the Internet, in 1971; he is internationally known and credited as the inventor of email. It was the first system able to send mail between users on different hosts connected to ARPANET. Previously, mail could be sent only to others who used the same computer. To achieve this, he used the @ sign to separate the user name from the name of their machine, a scheme which has been used in email addresses ever since.

                            A protocol that supports the sharing of resources that exist
                            in different packet switching networks was presented. The protocol provides
                            for variation in individual network packet sizes, transmission failures,
                            sequencing, flow control, end-to-end error checking, and the creation and
                            destruction of logical process-to-process connections. Some
                            implementation issues were considered, and problems such as internetwork
                            routing, accounting, and timeouts were exposed.

                        <p class="description">
                            The process of dividing TCP into two portions began in version 3 of TCP, written in 1978. The first formal standard for the versions of IP and TCP used in modern networks (version 4) were created in 1980. This is why the first “real” version of IP is version 4 and not version 1. TCP/IP quickly became the standard protocol set for running the ARPAnet. In the 1980s, more and more machines and networks were connected to the evolving ARPAnet using TCP/IP protocols, and the TCP/IP Internet was born.

                            In 1980, Tim Berners-Lee, an English independent contractor at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland, built ENQUIRE, as a personal database of people and software models, but also as a way to play with hypertext; each new page of information in ENQUIRE had to be linked to a page.

                            Paul Mockapetris and Jon Postel run the first successful test of the automated, distributed Domain Name System. DNS will lay the foundation for the massive expansion, popularization and commercialization of the internet. The fledgling internet of the time (Arpanet and CSnet) relied on a bulky and exponentially growing "phonebook" of addresses called the "host tables."

                            English scientist Sir Timothy Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland. The browser was released outside CERN to other research institutions starting in January 1991, and then to the general public in August 1991.

                            Marc Andreessen's realization of Mosaic, based on the work of Berners-Lee and the hypertext theorists before him, is generally recognized as the beginning of the web as it is now known. Mosaic, the first web browser to win over the Net masses, was released in 1993 and made freely accessible to the public.

                            Microsoft made Netscape an offer that they could not refuse. A onetime one-million-dollar fee to unlimited access to all of Netscape’s technology. If Netscape refused the deal, then Microsoft would use its resources to copy everything that they did. Netscape decided to launch an initial public offering and it was extremely successful. Jim Clark had invested 5 million into Netscape and earned 663 million on the day of the initial public offering. Marc Andreesen had publicly criticized Microsoft numerous times resulting in Microsoft releasing its own web browser- Internet Browser.
